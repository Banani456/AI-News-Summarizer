# AI-News-Summarizer
Developed an app that employs Gemini AI to create summaries of user-selected news articles from NewsAPI database.  Deployed with Tkinter GUI outputting the summaries into a downloadable .txt file and a separate app window. Convert to PDF feature is under development and testing as the libraries to run these functions are outdated or are currently swarmed with bugs - will be exterminated soon!

You will require your own API keys from Gemini API and NewsAPI to run these projects!
